                      EXPLANATION
                      
User Registration: Users sign up on the platform, creating accounts with their personal information.

Listing Items: Sellers create listings for the items or services they want to auction. They provide details such as item description, images, starting bid price, and auction duration.

Bidding: Interested buyers browse through the listings and place bids on the items they want to purchase. Bids are typically incremental, meaning each bid must be higher than the previous one.

Auction Duration: The auction runs for a specified duration, during which users can place bids on the item. The auction may have a fixed end time or be extended if there is bidding activity close to the deadline (e.g., a "soft closing" mechanism).

Winning Bid: When the auction ends, the highest bid wins the item. The winning bidder is notified, and they proceed with payment and finalizing the transaction.

Payment and Delivery: The winning bidder makes payment through the platform, and the seller arranges for the delivery or transfer of the item to the buyer.

Feedback and Ratings: After the transaction is completed, both the buyer and seller may leave feedback and ratings for each other based on their experience.

Dispute Resolution: In case of any disputes or issues during the transaction process, the auction platform may provide mechanisms for dispute resolution or customer support to resolve conflicts.
